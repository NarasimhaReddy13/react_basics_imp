*  React JS is UI Library
*  Developed by Facebook, Open Source, Released on 2013



Applications:
    * To develop Single Page Wed Applications
    * React Native (Similar syntax to React JS) - to develop Cross-Platform Mobile Applications 
    * Uses Virtual DOM for updating the DOM changes 



Virtual DOM :-- 
    * It takes lightweight copy of Real DOM - and keeps in memory and syncs with Real DOM by using ReactDOM Library
    * It improves lots of performance.



How to create React JS Project ????
    * npm install create-react-app -g
      create-react-app myproject

            (or)

    * npx create-react-app myproject --- it will create the create-react-app and delete create-react-app after project setup




JSX Syntax -:-- JavaScript + XML syntax
    JavaScript Syntax -:--    let button;

    XML Syntax -:---- <button> Click </button>     

    JSX Syntax :--  let button = <button> Click </button>





JSX is not mandatory (button recommended to use - Can build react applications very fast ) **




* we can also use -- babel syntax instead of JSX
import React from 'react'

let button = React.createElement('button', null, 'Hello')    
       ----- React.createElement(HTML Tag/React Component, Properties, Children)


**** Equivalent to     let button = <button> Hello </button>





To know babel syntax ----- Babel is the compiler for JSX Syntax
    * babeljs.io     -- in chrome
    * Click on ----   Try it out




onclick ---  onClick 
checked ---  defaultChecked
selected --- defaultSelected


style = "normal css"  ---- style = {{ camelCase css}}






<Button title='Click'> Hello </Button>  -- * try this once 
<Button title={'Click'} />



* Component name must starts with Capital 
  ( because there will be confusion in understanding whether it is a button Component   or   html button)




Props  --
    * is simply means  attributes in HTML
    * Any valid JS expression can be passed as data between components


    * The data can be passed in one way only (Unidirectional -- Top to Down)




State --
    * is a Local variable for the Component
    * Any state in one component won't be accessible to other component





==============================================================================================================================

* After running in terminal - If UI is not displayed automatically in default browser
    Then :-- 

            * Outside the project (i.e src) -- create a file --    .env.development 
            * In above file -----     BROWSER=chrome 



            * Can do some changes in index.js file -- and reload the browser ( automatic save will not work for some files )



this.state.users.map((user, index) => (
    <p className="" key={index}> {index} {user.name} </p>
))

* When to use this index as a key ????
    * Data must be static (i.e not be modified)
    * When we are not doing filterings


( when we add, item to start --- it checks all elements and replaces all elements -- so must use key )







<b> Developer </b>   --- bold 





css:
     transform: rotate(-45deg);
     position: absolute;
     top: 40px;
     left: -30px;
